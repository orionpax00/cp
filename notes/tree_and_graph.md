* Problems in Tree are very often to applying some sort of dfs or dynamic programming
* Similar to the the trees Problems of Graphs problems very often involves solving it for shortest path in differnt ways.

## Tree
* Terminologies: Root, Grand parent, parent, child, siblings, leaf, Ancestor, decendent, cousion, depth, height, diameter, etc.
* Types of Tree: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red Black Tree, Self Balanced Tree, B Tree, B+ Tree, etc.
* Full Binary Tree, Complete binary tree, Perfect Binary Tree, Balanced Binary Search Tree,
* Problems of tree are very open to dfs (using dp).
* Tree Traversal
    * BFS or (Level order traversal)
    * DFS 
        * Inorder (left->root->right)
        * Preorder (root->left->right)
        * Post order (left->right->root)
 
### Optimal Binary Search Tree

* For n keys (i.e n nodes) there are $\frac{2n_{C_n}}{n+1}$ binary trees are possible
* Tree for which the no. of comparisions are minimum is Balanced binary Search Tree.
* But when the frequencies of keys are given then the balanced binary search tree will not be an optimal search tree.
* So basically optimal binary search tree is more a problem then the concept, that is solved using dynamic programming.
